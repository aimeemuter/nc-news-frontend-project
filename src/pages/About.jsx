      <p>
        This is my Northcoders News frontend project. I created this website
        using JavaScript, React and React Router.
        <p>
          All users, articles and comments are fetched from my backend
          PostgreSQL API.
        </p>
      </p>
      <p>
        Feel free to navigate through the website and leave likes, dislikes and
        comments. Thank you for checking out my project, I hope you have a
        lovely day!
