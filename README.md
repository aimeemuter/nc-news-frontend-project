# NC News
I completed this front end project as part of the Software Development Bootcamp with Northcoders. I used my API (which was developed as a backend project) to create a user interface (UI) using React. I focussed on writing semantic HTML for accessibility and styled my application with native CSS.

**This project is hosted on Netlify at: https://aimeemuter-nc-news.netlify.app/**

Since 2023, more than 60% of internet browsing is done on mobile phones. Therefore, I created a responsive website with a mobile-first approach.

## Development
I was provided with a collection of user stories and it was up to me to create a wireframe and component tree for this website to satisfy all of the user stories. This is my first solo React project and my first time using CSS. I learnt a lot during the 1 week sprint.
